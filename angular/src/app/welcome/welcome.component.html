<h2>Introduction to the simulations</h2>

<p>
    <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Little Book of
            Semaphores</em></a>
    introduces concurrency techniques by presenting problems in which independent actors must be synchronized.
    The actors model threads of execution in a program (or, from an operating systems perspective,
    potentially multiple programs) which must access shared resources. Each problem has a set of
    constraints to satisfy for a correct solution which requires synchronization.
</p>

<p>
    Even with the correct solutions as detailed in <em>The Little Book of Semaphores</em>, it can be
    difficult to conceptualize the behavior of a program with multiple threads of execution.
    Stochastic and unexpected behavior mean that it's not always easy or even possible to trace
    program execution to understand what's going on. The goal of these simulations is to provide
    a way to visualize these concurrency problems to get a better understanding of them.
</p>

<p>
    As soon as you hit "Go", the server begins executing the program. As the threads do work,
    they communicate their state which gets shown in the form of a visualization, which can be
    played in live time (even if the server hasn't finished executing). You can
    play the visualization to see how the solutions work or step through it manually for better
    detail. After the simulations finish running, a summary record is saved that can be viewed
    to analyze how changing parameters affects throughput, starvation, or fairness.

<h3><a href="https://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf#section.4.4" target="blank">Dining
        Philosophers</a></h3>

<p>
    In Dining Philosophers, <code>n</code> philosophers are sitting around a round table with
    <code>n</code> forks between them. Philosophers have two activities: eating and thinking.
    When philosophers become hungry, they must acquire both forks to either side of themselves,
    then they eat for a period of time, and finally they replace the forks to the table and
    return to thinking for a while. There are three solutions to this problem, the first is
    incorrect and can cause deadlock. The second solves it by use of a footman to ensure at most
    <code>n - 1</code> philosophers are holding forks at a time. Finally, the third solution breaks
    circular wait by ensuring at least one philosopher is a lefty and picks up the forks in a
    different order.

<h3><a href="https://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf#section.4.2" target="blank">Readers &
        Writers</a></h3>

<p>
    In Readers &amp; Writers, a set of <code>n</code> readers and <code>m</code> writers need concurrent
    access to a datastore. Any number of readers can access the file at once, but at most one writer
    can access the file to prevent inconsistent state. There are three solutions to this problem. The first
    is starvation prone as readers can continue to access the file without yielding to writers. The second
    solves this with a turnstile but with lowered throughput. The third solution can also experience
    starvation by giving priority to writers, but there are situations where this may be appropriate.

<h3><a href="https://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf#section.4.1" target="blank">Bounded
        Buffer</a></h3>

<p>
    In Bounded Buffer, a set of <code>n</code> producers and <code>m</code> consumers are writing to and
    reading from a buffer, respectively. The buffer has a fixed size. Producers must wait for a slot
    in the buffer to become available if the buffer is full and consumers must wait for an item if
    the buffer is empty. There is one working solution to this problem in which producers and consumers
    use counting semaphores to ensure there are slots to use before attempting to access the buffer.

        Bathroom</a></h3>

<p>
    In Unisex Bathroom, a set of <code>n</code> males and <code>m</code> females need concurrent access
    to a bathroom, however only one sex at a time is permitted to use the bathroom, and only up to a
    given fixed capacity. There are two solutions to this problem, one of which is starvation prone and
    the other which uses a turnstile to maintain fairness.
